Hello, dear
    I'm Shwe Sin Ei, but it's difficult for some people to pronounce my name. So, can you call me Goldie?
    I'm originally from Myanmar. I aspire to be a developer and enjoy reading, gardening, meditation, and yoga.
    I want to meet new people because I have some flaws, such as being afraid of meeting new people and taking the first step. 
    That is not fair, because if we want to be developers, we must be curious about everything in our environment. 
    To improve our brain and thinking abilities, we should keep an open mind.
